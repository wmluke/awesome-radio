â”œâ”€â”€ app/                  Main app folder...contains components, routes, etc   
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ models      Primsa DB queries
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ root.tsx    Root of the Remix UI
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ routes      File based http routing         
â”œâ”€â”€ cypress/              Cypress E2E tests 
â”œâ”€â”€ prisma/               DB ORM: db migrations and seed
â””â”€â”€ public/               Public static assets
```

### Getting Started

1. Create `.env` file from `.env.example`

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

3. Migrate & Seed the SQLite DB

```shell
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma db seed
```

Notes:
- Seeding adds a testuser account and imports stations from a remote json content source.
- The db schema, migrations, and seed steps are located in the [prisma](prisma) folder.

### Running

```shell
npm run dev
```

Note: If you have not seeded the DB, then you'll need to create an user account to a content source to import stations.

### Testing

Run unit tests

```shell
npm run test
```

Run E2E tests

```shell
npm run test:e2e:run
```

Run all checks

```shell
npm run validate
```

## Deployment

This project uses Github actions to deploy changes pushed to the `main` branch to [fly.io](https://fly.io).

The deployment pipeline is defined in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
and [fly.toml](fly.toml). Application packaging and runtime are detailed in [Dockerfile](Dockerfile). Authentication to
fly.io is enabled by
a `FLY_API_TOKEN` [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

The following commands were used to initialize the fly application.

```shell
fly apps create awesome-radio-1ae3
fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app awesome-radio-1ae3
fly volumes create data --size 1 --app awesome-radio-1ae3
fly scale memory 512 --app awesome-radio-1ae3
```

For details on installing the `flyctl` cli, see [here](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/).
